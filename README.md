# Diagnosing COVID-19 Patients Using A Pretrained VGG16
I conducted this project because I found an interesting dataset that was put together by Adrian Rosebrock, at pyimagesearch. I was inspired after seeing his version of a convolutional network to classify the coronavirus. 

The dataset contains X-ray images of the lungs of individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 (Coronavirus). Also in the dataset are X-ray images of the lungs of individuals who had lung infections not related to the coronavirus. 

This CNN utilizes a VGG16 network that is pre-trained on ImageNet for the base model. Keras and TensorFlow were utilized for the creation of this project.
